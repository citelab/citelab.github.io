description: JAMEmulator is an emulator for constructing testbeds for experimenting with cloud of things. It uses Mininet (in particular the Mininet-WiFi) to emulate different scenarios. It uses a unique physical object modeling scheme to create a simple scheme to embed virtual machines (Mininet containers) in emulated physical spaces. These virtual machines can be connected to each other and to the Internet by wireless or wired connections. Also, the emulator is capable of representing the behavior of events. Using this feature, the applications running in the virtual machines can generate or capture the events.
