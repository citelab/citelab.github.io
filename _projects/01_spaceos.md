description: Space OS is novel operating system concept for 5G edge computing, where
space is a first order notion. The device-centric model of traditional operating systems is supplanted by space-oriented computing model. This model allows a natural way of managing computing we perform in physical spaces that are getting packed by smart 
devices.
