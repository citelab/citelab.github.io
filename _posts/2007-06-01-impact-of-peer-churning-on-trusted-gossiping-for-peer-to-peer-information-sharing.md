In a recent study we proposed a trusted gossip protocol for rumor resistant information sharing in peer-to- peer networks. Experiments using trace data collected from social networks like Flickr and other data sets showed that the trusted protocol can achieve significant reductions in rumor spreading with reasonable message and processing overheads. The study, however, did not consider node churn - a continuous process of node arrival and departure. In this paper, we show through experiments that the trusted gossip protocol can continue to perform equally well with churning nodes as in no-churn situations. We examine the trusted gossip protocol using synthetic and real traces for node churning collected from the Myspace social network. Our experiments show that the trusted protocol performance is considerably resilient even to extreme churning conditions.
