Epidemic protocols such as gossip have proven to have many desirable properties for information sharing. However, trust is one of the issues that is yet to be examined with respect to these protocols. In this paper, we present a trusted gossip protocol that uses trust estimates to impede spreading of rumors with reasonable message and processing overheads. We use traces collected from known social networks to estimate the performance of trusted gossip.
