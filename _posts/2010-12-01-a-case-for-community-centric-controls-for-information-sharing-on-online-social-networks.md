In this paper, for controlling information sharing in online social networks (OSNs) we present a community-centric access control mechanism called myCommunity. We develop heuristic ideas for efficiently computing myCommunities in OSNs and evaluate it using traces from actual OSNs. The experimental results indicate that myCommunity is a feasible idea and simple estimation strategies can be effective to obtain an initial value. In ongoing work, we are extending myCommunity to incorporate the dynamic nature of the trust within OSNs.
