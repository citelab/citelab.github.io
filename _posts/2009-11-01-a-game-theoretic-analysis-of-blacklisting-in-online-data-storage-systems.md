In this paper, we investigate the problem of online data sharing on social networks from a game theoretic framework. We introduce blacklisting as trigger strategy to elicit cooperation among the players of a noncooperative sharing game. Using game theoretic analysis, we show the existence of an equilibrium in which the sharing conditions are honored when the involved players employ blacklisting strategies.
