SpaceOS is a system software stack for smart computing environments. The major objective of SpaceOS is to make it easier to create applications and deploy them in smart computing environments. It provides several core services for managing smart devices in physical spaces and letting them interact with cloud backends and web-based users. SpaceOS also supports a programming language called Jade that leverages the facilities provided by the system software stack to provide a simpler programming model for the things.
