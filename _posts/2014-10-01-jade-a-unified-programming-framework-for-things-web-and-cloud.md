In this paper, we present JADE, a framework that allows a developer to mix C and JavaScript constructs with JADE supplied keywords to construct a complete program to solve a particular computing activity in a ‘thing’. We describe the language constructs introduced by JADE and explain how they can be used to realize different software interaction patterns involving the thing, web, and cloud. We implemented a proof-of- concept prototype of JADE over Intel Galileos, web, and cloud. The experience of using JADE to write applications on Intel Galileos is described in the paper.
