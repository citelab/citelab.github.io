One of the key challenges in digital media distribution is digital rights management (DRM). DRM is a classic example of a problem that arises due to incentive misalignments that exists among transacting parties in a network. Because of misaligned incentives users have the inclination to break DRM if it becomes technically possible. This paper draws upon work in group lending and social psychology to develop a novel social media distribution scheme. The key objective is to x the incentive misalignment that exists between the users and media distributors. Using game theoretic modelling, certain conditions that should hold for social media distribution to work are educed.
