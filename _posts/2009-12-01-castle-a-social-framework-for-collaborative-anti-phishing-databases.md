Phishing is a major problem on the Internet. The cornerstone of anti-phishing is detecting whether a given site is good or bad. Most of the approaches for anti-phishing rely on looking up centrally maintained repositories. In this paper, we present a decentralized framework called CASTLE that allows a collaborative approach for anti-phishing services. We implemented a prototype and then tested it on Planet-lab. The experiments indicate the viability of our framework.
