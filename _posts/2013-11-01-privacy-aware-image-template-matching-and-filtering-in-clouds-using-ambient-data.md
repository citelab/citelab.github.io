Cloud computing is ideal for image storage and processing because it provides enormously scalable storage and processing resources at low cost. One of the major drawbacks of cloud computing, however, is the lack of robust mecha- nisms for the users to control the privacy of the data they farm out to the clouds. In this paper, we develop an image encoding scheme that enhances the privacy of image data that is outsourced to the clouds for processing. Unlike previously proposed image encryption schemes, our encoding scheme allows different forms of pixel-level image processing to take place in the clouds while the actual im- age is not revealed to the cloud provider. Our encoding scheme uses a chaotic map to transform the image after it is masked with an arbitrarily chosen ambi- ent image. We use numerous pixel-level image processing tasks such as template matching to demonstrate the ability of our scheme to perform computations on privacy enhanced images. A simplified prototype of the image processing system was implemented and the experimental results are presented in this paper.
