The scale and cost efficiencies provided by clouds make them ideal platforms for handling data intensive applications in variety of different sectors including e-health, e-commerce, and surveillance applications. This chapter investigates the privacy and security issues of large data sets that are stored and processed in cloud computing systems. If the experience gained from web-based transaction management systems is any indication, the safety of data held by cloud computing systems is not impregnable. There are various factors contributing to the data insecurity including the data handling policies adopted by the cloud operators, best practices adopted by the cloud provider in recycling used storage elements, and characteristics of the data handled by the clouds.
