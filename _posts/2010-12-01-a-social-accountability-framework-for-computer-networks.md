We present an accountability framework for the Internet which ties a user's action to her identity on an online social network. The framework is optional in that users do not need to be accountable at all times, but various web services can force accountability on the part of their users by only allowing accountable users access. Our design is general enough that higher level applications can place additional policies/restrictions on the basic accountability provided. In this paper, we introduce the design, discuss how various applications can be mapped onto our framework, and provide performance numbers from an experimental prototype.
