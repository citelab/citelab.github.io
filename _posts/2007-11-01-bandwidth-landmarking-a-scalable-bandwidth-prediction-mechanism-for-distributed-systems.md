This paper presents a new bandwidth inference mechanism that can be used to predict bandwidth across two nodes on the Internet. We used simulation and actual implementation on PlanetLab to compare the performance of the proposed mechanism against an existing approach. The results indicate that our approach is lightweight and yields better performance.
