Usernames and passwords that rely on the “something you know” factor is still the mainstay of authenticating on the web. In a mobile web, where users interact using mobile devices (mainly cellular phones), the username and password approach to authentication is not ideal.We need implicit approaches that require very little or no input from the users. This paper presents a new approach to use the “someone you know” factor for authentication using mobile phones. We have implemented the authentication protocol on Nokia N95 phones. We present some initial performance results from the implementation to demonstrate the viability of the approach in terms of time required to run the protocol and battery life.
