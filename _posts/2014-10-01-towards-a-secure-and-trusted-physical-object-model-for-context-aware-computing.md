For smart gadgets to gain wider acceptance, we need to de- velop things that can program themselves as users manipulate them to perform their day-to-day chores (a good example is the Nest intelligent thermostat [1]). Users can interact with a ‘thing’ in the physical environment in many different ways including: (a) directly manipulating the thing by using the controls and menus offered by it, (b) moving it from one position to another position, and (c) bringing the thing near the proximity of other things that create a combination with specific capabilities (moving a smart chair near a smart desk). In this extended abstract, we describe a design for a secure and trusted physical object model (POM) that can be used to describe spaces and smart things for context aware computing purposes.
