This paper investigates how a hybrid hosting platform made from dedicated and opportunistic resources can be used to host data stream processing applications. We pro- pose a system model for the hybrid hosting platform and develop resource management algorithms that are neces- sary to coordinate the allocation of the two classes of resources to the stream processing tasks. We used extensive simulations driven by traces styled from realistic system observations for evaluating the proposed resource alloca- tion heuristics. The results show that with proper man- agement, the synergy of dedicated and opportunistic re- sources yields considerably higher service throughput and thus, higher return on investment over expensive dedicated resources.
