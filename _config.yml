# Projects
research:
  - topic: Cloud & Fogs
    icon: fas fa-cloud
    description: We are investigating cloud & fog architectures for executing tasks with near real-time processing requirements. For example, managing tasks injected from vehicular systems into cloud or edge-based computing backends for processing.

  - topic: Intelligent Internet of Things
    icon: fas fa-laptop
    description: We are working on middleware and programming frameworks for IoT that would self-organize the IoT and edge computing systems for optimal placement of task executions. We are using machine learning for optimizing handover and also data transfer with edge-based IoT.

  - topic: Networking Toolkits
    icon: fas fa-network-wired
    description: We are implementing easy-to-use networking toolkits, high-level toolkits for experimenting with clouds, software-defined networks, and virtual network functions. This work started as a teaching toolkit and is quickly evolving as a research platform into novel distributed cloud architectures combining Clouds, SDN and NFV.
